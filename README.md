1. Prerequisites:
Authenticate with GCP
  Use a service account key or gcloud CLI to authenticate Terraform with your GCP project.
gcloud auth application-default login   # copy it in browser and copy the code and paste in cloud shell.
GCP account and project set up.


Verify GCP Authentication:
Ensure that you are authenticated with Google Cloud and have the necessary permissions.
Steps:
Check if you are logged in:
gcloud auth list

If no account is listed,

log in using:
gcloud auth login

Set the correct project:
gcloud config set project raghuram-gcp-1





Verify application default credentials:
gcloud auth application-default login
note: This command ensures that Terraform can use your credentials to authenticate with GCP.

Check permissions:

Ensure the account you are using has the necessary permissions to create and manage resources in GCP. 
The following roles are typically required:
roles/editor
roles/iam.securityAdmin
roles/compute.networkAdmin

GCP credentials configured locally.




 terraform installation process:

wget -O - https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform

Terraform installed.


2. Testing Instructions:

Provide the Load Balancer IP or URL to test the "Hello World" function.

3. ZIP command:

zip the Cloud Function code:
   ```bash
   cd cloud_function
   zip -r function.zip main.py requirements.txt # For Python



4. Testing the Cloud Function Locally:

Before deploying, you can test the Cloud Function locally to ensure it works as expected.
Python

cd cloud_function

a. Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

b. Run the function locally:
functions-framework --target hello_world

c. Test the function by visiting http://localhost:8080 in your browser or using curl:

curl http://localhost:8080

5. Deployment Instructions:

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply


6.Destroy Instructions:
terraform destroy

7. If you want confirmation before deleting each file inside the directory, use:
rm -ri cloud_function_basic_project
